### Reflections and Comments
* First commit of this project focused on the Javascript and html portion. 
* I tackled this project with JS first, HMTL second and CSS last. I found it most helpful to lay out the scaffolding for each of the file's structures before putting in the content.

* Second Commit of this project focused on Javascript as well - this time with more attention on conditional statements such as if/else and arrays of data.
* I tackled this project using the resources available in the JS Book from Jon Duckett.
